## üé® Customization

### Colors and Theming

The theme uses CSS custom properties for easy customization. Override these in your own CSS:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #your-color;
  --color-secondary: #your-color;
  --font-family-sans: "Your Font", sans-serif;
}
```

### Custom CSS

Add custom styles by creating `assets/css/custom.css` in your site:

```css
/* Your custom styles */
.my-custom-class {
  /* Custom styles */
}
```

### Custom Layouts

Override any template by creating the same file structure in your site's `layouts/` directory:

```
layouts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _default/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ single.html    # Override single post layout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ partials/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ header.html    # Override header partial
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # Override homepage layout
```

### AI-Assisted Styling

The Hugo Base Theme is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. Here are effective prompts for customizing your theme:

#### Color Scheme Customization
```
"Update the CSS custom properties in themes/base-theme/assets/css/main.css to use a [blue/green/purple] color scheme. Keep the existing structure but change the primary colors to create a cohesive [modern/professional/vibrant] look."
```

#### Component Styling
```
"Add CSS styles to make the post cards have a [glassmorphism/neumorphism/minimalist] design. The cards should have [subtle shadows/rounded corners/gradient backgrounds] while maintaining accessibility and the existing responsive behavior."
```

#### Layout Modifications
```
"Modify the header layout in themes/base-theme/layouts/partials/header.html to add a [search bar/social icons/call-to-action button] while keeping the existing navigation structure and mobile responsiveness."
```

#### Typography Enhancements
```
"Update the typography system to use [Google Fonts/system fonts] with a [serif/sans-serif] font stack. Ensure proper font loading performance and maintain the existing font size scale."
```

#### Dark Mode Customization
```
"Enhance the dark mode theme with [warmer/cooler] colors and add [accent colors/gradient backgrounds] while maintaining WCAG AA contrast ratios."
```

#### Animation and Interactions
```
"Add subtle CSS animations to [buttons/cards/navigation] with [fade/slide/scale] effects. Use CSS transitions and respect the prefers-reduced-motion setting for accessibility."
```

#### Mobile Optimization
```
"Improve the mobile experience by adjusting [spacing/typography/navigation] for screens under 768px. Focus on [touch targets/readability/performance] while maintaining the existing responsive grid."
```

#### Performance Enhancements
```
"Optimize the CSS by [removing unused styles/combining selectors/improving specificity] while maintaining all existing functionality and visual design."
```

#### Tips for AI Collaboration:
- **Be Specific**: Mention exact file paths and CSS class names
- **Preserve Functionality**: Ask to maintain existing responsive behavior and accessibility features
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test changes across different screen sizes and themes
- **Incremental Changes**: Make one modification at a time for easier debugging
- **Backup First**: Keep copies of working files before major changes
